## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

Hi, I'm **Syed Khalid Tipu Razvi**. I am a cybersecurity enthusiast and aspiring **Information Security Analyst**.

I am currently building my skills in **Blue Team Operations** and defense, while actively exploring my true passion for **Red Team Operations** and the offensive side of security. I enjoy the challenge of finding vulnerabilities and believe that understanding how to break a system is the best way to learn how to secure it.

Currently, I am pursuing my Masters in **Computer Networks and Information Security** while documenting my learning journey through CTF challenges and projects.

## ⚔️ My Arsenal

I am actively learning and using these tools in my labs and CTFs:

* **Offense (Red Team):** Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, Nessus, Wire Shark, OSINT.
* **Defense (Blue Team):** Splunk, Wireshark,
* **Scripting:** Python, Bash, HTML

## 📬 Connect

I am open to opportunities in **Penetration Testing** and **Security Analysis**,**Security Operations Center(SOC)** or just discussing a hard CTF challenge.
